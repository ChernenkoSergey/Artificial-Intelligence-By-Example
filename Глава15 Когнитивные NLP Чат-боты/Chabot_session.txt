COGNITIVE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
Conceptual Representation Learning Meta Model(CRL-MM): 
 concepts in words+images. 

In chapter 8, the Google_Translate_Customized.py  
 program found an error in Google Translate.
Google Translate confused a sports coach with a vehicle-coach. 
 In the near future, Google will probably correct this example  
 but here are thousands of other confusions.
On line 48 of Google_Translate_Customized.py, a deeper_translate function  
 was added to correct such errors.  
 This was only possible because Google provides  
 the necessary tools for the AI community to help make progress.
The translation was corrected so that the word bus replaced coach 
  and Google translated the sentence correctly
This program extends polysemy deeper understanding to concepts: 
  words and images 

This model can be added to 
 deep_translate in Google_Translate_Customized at line 114 or
deployed in a cognitive chabot as follows...
