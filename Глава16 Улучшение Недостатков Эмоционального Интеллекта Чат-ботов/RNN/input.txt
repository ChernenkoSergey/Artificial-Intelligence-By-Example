The action movie was boring. The comedy was better. Next time, I'll watch an action comedy with funny scenes. Action movies really keep my mind busy. But if they become too noisy and violent, some humor makes it better. I prefer autumn because the leaves are brown, yellow, orange, red and all sorts of colors. Summer is too hot, winter is too cold, spring comes with allergies. Too many landscapes in movies are a real bore. I like some but not too much. Love is really something great. I like movies with some warmth in them.
